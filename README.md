Make sure Node is installed (preferably a version before Node 17)


In order to start the program do:

**npm install**

Once that's finished:

**npm start**


If there's any errors preventing the program from running (it doesn't recognize the import) do:

**npm install [import name]**


If that doesn't run the pgoram, double check if the version of Node that's installed is a Node Version before Node 17.
